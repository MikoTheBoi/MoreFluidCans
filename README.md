<h1 align="center">More Fluid Cans</h1>
<p align="center">A mod that adds the Copper Can from <a href="https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct"> Tinkers Construct</a> and more variants!</p>
<p align="center"><b>This is <i>not</i> an addon for Tconstruct and does <i>not</i> use it as a dependency!</b></p>

## Currently adds
- Copper Can - Stackable container that holds 1 ingot of fluid
- Emerald Can - Stackable container that holds 1 gem of fluid
- Brick Can - Stackable container that holds 1 brick of fluid

## Credits
- Code and Copper Can assets from [Tinkers Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct) by [SlimeKnights](https://github.com/SlimeKnights)
- Code from [Hephaestus](https://github.com/Alpha-s-Stuff/TinkersConstruct) by [Alpha-s-Stuff](https://github.com/Alpha-s-Stuff)

## Scope
- Make items datadriven to make adding custom variants easier for pack developers
- Add recipes to the cans (this isn't really scope just something I forgot to add)
- Optimizing code lol
  ### Not in scope
  - (Neo)Forge ports, these already have better options than this mod
  - Ports to newer versions, if the mod gets popular enough to warrant this I might do it
