<h1 align="center">More Fluid Cans</h1>
<p align="center">A mod that adds the Copper Can from [Tinkers Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct) and more variants!</p>
<p align="center">**This is _not_ an addon for Tconstruct and does _not_ use it as a dependency!**</p>

## Currently adds
- Copper Can - Stackable container that holds 1 ingot of fluid
- Emerald Can - Stackable container that holds 1 gem of fluid
- Brick Can - Stackable container that holds 1 brick of fluid

## Scope
- Make items datadriven to make adding custom variants easier for pack developers
- Optimizing code lol
  # Not in scope
  - (Neo)Forge ports, these already have better options than this mod
  - Ports to newer versions, if the mod gets popular enough to warrant this I might do it
